    "text": "Our mission is to train the next generations of AI innovators, equipping them with the expertise and skills to co-design and build practice-oriented AI systems for science and research domains of key national importance. Our innovative, cohort-based training programme will deliver highly-trained PhD graduates with the transferable skills to deliver impact while solving societally important problems in responsible ways.\n\nPractice-oriented AI is about bridging the gap between between complex problem domains such as those found in science and research, and AI algorithms and techniques that could be used to solve problems in those domains. PrO-AI research will fundamentally advance the state of the art in methodologies for building AI systems, similar to the way software engineering developed sophisticated methodologies for programmers to work in a problem-driven way. This will result in AI systems that are demonstrably finely attuned to the problem they solve, and hence more usable, quicker to develop, and easier to maintain. As such, beneficiaries include everyone working with AI systems, be they users, developers, managers, decision makers, etc.\nWhile the current, media-driven narrative focuses on the disruptive nature of selected AI technologies, research organisations working towards incorporating AI methods strongly prefer to do so in a way that maximally respects their well-established practices. The key AI challenges of tomorrow are posed by the need for a deeper cooperation and alignment between AI systems, AI practitioners, and domain experts, the latter being the source of both relevant case-specific knowledge and requirements with regards to functionality, robustness, transparency, accountability and fairness for a given application. In other words, we need AI experts with the ability to act as a bridge between domain experts and AI technology. But rather than delivering ‘AI for x’ experts for a fixed domain x – which might quickly lose its importance or utility – the PrO-AI doctoral training programme will deliver experts with the flexibility to adapt to new domains during the course of their career.\nThe PrO-AI CDT pulls together the University of Bristol’s proven track record in doctoral AI training and its unique and comprehensive strengths in AI applied to a range of science and research areas including health, environment and energy, and creative industries, to deliver highly-trained AI innovators with the transferable skills to deliver societal impact across domains."

    "text": "Here is a list of research projects in Interactive AI that we are currently recruiting to. We are asking applicants to base their research statement on one of these. Further projects may become available in due course and will be added here.\n\nDigital waste in Interactive AI\nDigital waste is defined as the use of digital infrastructure for services that are not or only partly enjoyed by the user. Design techniques that can reduce demand on infrastructure will thus contribute to the reduction of environmental impact. As Interactive AI applications embed the human in an interaction loop with a digital device, it is particularly relevant to consider digital waste. Working with Dr Daniel Schien, you will investigate digital waste from two complementary angles: reducing digital waste in Interactive AI applications; and applying Interactive AI to reduce digital waste in ICT services in general.\n\n\nInteractive AI for dealing with bias in language\nNatural language processing (NLP) is finding new uses in a wide range of applications, such as recruitment, healthcare, policing, advertising and social media monitoring. NLP models can learn and may even amplify social biases and stereotypes, resulting in automated systems making unfair decisions against certain groups of people. To address the problem, new analysis tools are required that let domain experts probe models for different forms of bias and evaluate and adjust techniques like adversarial debiasing. Working with Dr Edwin Simpson, you will develop novel techniques and create interactive tools for analysing and correcting such biases.\n\n\nInteractive AI to help understand Parkinson’s disease\nThe availability of real-time information through the increasing capabilities of sensing devices has led to the emergence of research into Activity Recognition. Investigating the activities and sleep patterns of patients with a condition such as Parkinson’s Disease can help to understand the progression of the disease and the effect of medications. Working with Dr Zahraa Abdallah, you will develop novel Interactive AI techniques for analysing accelerometer data collected by wrist-worn sensors, examine episodes of sleep and identify distinguishing features, unusual patterns, and sleep quality measures.\n\n\nProsociality as a foundation for ethics and fairness in Interactive AI\nCurrent research on ethics and fairness in Interactive AI focuses on a single agent, often associated with an entity such as a mortgage lender or a judge. It is often more appropriate to model ethics and fairness as a social concern between prosocial agents. Working with Dr Nirav Ajmeri, you will uncover the principles of prosociality on which AI agents can interact with each other and with humans to realize fair outcomes for the humans involved. Such agents would (autonomously) behave prosocially and (collaboratively) strengthen prosociality among human actors by facilitating their awareness of each other’s needs and preferences.\n\n\nInteractive modelling of language\nWithin the field of computational linguistics there are different ways to model language: corpus based approaches which generate meaning from large bodies of text; the evolutionary linguistic approach which derives meaning from interaction with the outside world and with other agents; and the vector-symbolic approach which can be implemented in more biologically plausible artificial neural networks. Working with Dr Martha Lewis, you will unify these three approaches to propose a model of language that is compositional, interactive, and has a neural implementation, opening up the framework to teaching through interaction with a human."

    "text": "In close conversation with our industry partners, we identified Practice-Oriented Artificial Intelligence (PrO-AI) as a core sub-discipline of AI where the need for and deficit in skills is abundantly evident, while being homogeneous enough to have intellectual integrity and be explored and researched within the context of a single CDT. The most important aspects of the bespoke training programme are:\n\nPractice projects will be run in close collaboration with CDT partners (academic and industry) and across CDT cohorts to offer ‘deep dives’ into a research domain. Students will liaise with domain experts to get an understanding of their expertise, expectations and success criteria. Exploring different domains will allow the students to acquire the transferable skills that will be key when moving between domains in their future careers.\nThe Foundations of Practice-Oriented AI module is run in a student-led, ‘flipped classroom’ manner and covers the main topics in data-driven AI, knowledge-intensive AI and human-AI interaction; human-centred and participatory methodologies to bring those AI techniques into practice; and the legal and ethical context that will help students to do so responsibly and in a manner beneficial to society.\nAcademic mentors attend the sessions to gauge their mentee’s knowledge and identify areas where further study will be beneficial as part of the Research Orientation module, which completes a student’s foundational training in an individual-centred manner and guides them on the way to choosing a research topic for the Summer Project and subsequent PhD research.\nThroughout their programme the students participate in and build an online portfolio of transferable skills training inspired by the Vitae Researcher Development Framework. This includes training in responsible innovation, entrepreneurship, hosting visitors, organising events, public engagement, citizen science, etc. A ‘serious game’ approach will encourage students to build their Researcher Development portfolio, unlocking additional research and training support resources when they reach certain milestones."
