Each year we offer ~10 fully-funded, 4 year UKRI studentships covering:

    - £22,106 tax-free stipend per year for living expenses (increased in 2022 from £20,500
      in response to high inflation) 
    - Tuition fees at UK student rates
    - £2,000 per year for equipment and travel allowance supporting research related activities.

These studentships are governed by UKRI/EPSRC student eligibility rules and applicants should check whether they will be eligible. We are able to offer 1-2 studentships each year to non-UK students (with international tuition fees being waived)

Applications received from self-funded/sponsored international and EU students are welcome and will be considered. 

Information about additional funding sources can be found on the University’s fees and funding pages, the University’s International Scholarships webpage and the Faculty of Engineering postgraduate funding webpage.
