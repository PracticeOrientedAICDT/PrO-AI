## Entry Requirements

Applicants must hold/achieve a minimum of an upper-second class honours degree (or international equivalent)
in a relevant discipline. The Interactive Artificial Intelligence CDT is primarily aimed at students with a
first degree in engineering or science and with strong programming skills, but will also consider applicants
with suitable skills acquired in employment.

Online applications are expected to be opened in early 2024 for a September 2024 start.
